<h1><a name="size">Images of different sizes or dimensions</a></h1>
<p>To resize a web image without IIIF, we would need to download the file and open it in a separate software program, such as Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Paint, then resize it and save the resulting image as a separate file. However, if we want to display the image on the web using IIIF, we don't need to create a separate derivative file. Instead, we can request the size we want using the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/" target="_blank">IIIF Image API</a>, and the image server will respond with the resized image.</p>

<p>The steps for manually requesting a resized image (given the IIIF manifest) are listed below. Although we use Vault as an example, the same instructions will work for any manifest that is backed by a IIIF image server and is level 1 or level 2 compliant (<a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/compliance/" target="_blank">more on levels of Image API compliance</a>).</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the object's manifest page. We'll use <a href="https://vault.library.uvic.ca/concern/generic_works/1a597e67-17a8-4c97-9c63-c835a41f5474/manifest.json" target="_blank">this Vault manifest</a> as the example for the rest of this tutorial.</li>
    <li>Scroll through the manifest until you reach the "canvases" section. From here, you'll need to find the canvas that corresponds to the image you're looking for. Depending on the IIIF viewer you're using, it may be faster to search the canvases by title rather than by counting X no. of images from the start.</li>
    <li>From the canvas, follow the manifest down to images > resource > service > @id. This should be a URL (that also contains as the unique identifier for this particular image). For our example, this @id is <a href="https://vault.library.uvic.ca/images/0a4d3d9f-210a-47be-b89d-a627ea4c570f%252Ffiles%252Fde77c7a9-77fb-4d9e-aa54-87b51b16fd1f" target="_blank">https://vault.library.uvic.ca/images/0a4d3d9f-210a-47be-b89d-a627ea4c570f%252Ffiles%252Fde77c7a9-77fb-4d9e-aa54-87b51b16fd1f</a>. (Note that if you were actually to visit this link, you would get the info.json response for that image.)</li>

        <figcaption class="sr-only">The section of the JSON manifest that contains the canvas, image, and @id attribute for the correct service. The full @id attribute is https://vault.library.uvic.ca/images/0a4d3d9f-210a-47be-b89d-a627ea4c570f%252Ffiles%252Fde77c7a9-77fb-4d9e-aa54-87b51b16fd1f</figcaption>

    <li><p>Paste this @id into our browser (but don't hit Enter or visit the link).
    <li>Use the <a href="https://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#size">size parameter</a> to change the image's size to what we want. For example, to request the full image at its full/maximum size, we would add "/full/full/0/default.jpg" to the end. So the link to the full image is <a href="https://vault.library.uvic.ca/images/0a4d3d9f-210a-47be-b89d-a627ea4c570f%252Ffiles%252Fde77c7a9-77fb-4d9e-aa54-87b51b16fd1f/full/full/0/default.jpg" target="_blank">https://vault.library.uvic.ca/images/0a4d3d9f-210a-47be-b89d-a627ea4c570f%252Ffiles%252Fde77c7a9-77fb-4d9e-aa54-87b51b16fd1f/full/full/0/default.jpg</a>.</p></li>
        <p>As another example, for a <a href="https://vault.library.uvic.ca/images/0a4d3d9f-210a-47be-b89d-a627ea4c570f%252Ffiles%252Fde77c7a9-77fb-4d9e-aa54-87b51b16fd1f/full/150,/0/default.jpg" target="_blank">thumbnail of the full image that is 150px wide</a>, we would add "/full/150,/0/default.jpg" to the end instead.
